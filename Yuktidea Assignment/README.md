## About this project

This landing page was developed by me on July 30, 2022, as part of an assignment for Yuktidea. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
## Task Done âœ“

## ðŸ‘‡ Additional 
- On the landing page, I added a header to give it a more attractive appearance.
- The assignment mail did not include a share icon or an environmentally friendly icon. So I used flaticons to add it.
## ðŸš€ Approach

- I began the project by creating the user interface (UI) of the landing page using HTML code, styling it with CSS, and adding functionality using Javascript in accordance with the provided prototype.
- The landing page was then made responsive for viewing on mobile and tablet devices by adding a media query.
